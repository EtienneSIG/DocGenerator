# Functional Documentation

This script is designed to generate a technical and functional markdown documentation of a Python script using OpenAI. 

The script reads a Python file, tokenizes it and sends the tokens to the OpenAI API for translation. The translated text is then written into a markdown file.

The script requires a configuration file (config.json) with details of the OpenAI API key, endpoint, model ID, API version and the maximum number of tokens to be generated by the model.

The script can be run from the command line with the filename as an argument. The output is a markdown file with the same name as the input file, containing the translated text.
