## Module Dependencies
- ntpath
- argparse
- os
- sys
- re
- openai
- nltk
- json

## Configuration
The script uses a configuration file (config.json) to load the following parameters:
- OPENAI_API_KEY: The API key for OpenAI.
- OPENAI_API_BASE: The base endpoint for OpenAI.
- OPENAI_NB_TOKENS: The maximum number of tokens to be generated by the model.
- COMPLETIONS_MODEL: The ID of the model to be used for completions.
- OPENAI_API_VERSION: The version of the OpenAI API to be used.

## Function Definitions

### get_token_count(prompt)
This function takes a string input 'prompt' and returns the number of tokens in the string.

### openaiTraduction(prompt, endpoint, key, model_id, api_version)
This function performs the translation using OpenAI. It takes the following parameters:
- 'prompt': the text to be translated.
- 'endpoint': the OpenAI API endpoint.
- 'key': the OpenAI API key.
- 'model_id': the ID of the model to be used for the translation.
- 'api_version': the version of the OpenAI API to be used.

### writeOuput(strOpenAI, DocumentName)
This function writes the translated text into a markdown file. It takes two parameters:
- 'strOpenAI': the translated text.
- 'DocumentName': the name of the output markdown file.

## Command Line Execution
The script can be run from the command line with the following syntax:
```
python DocGen.py -f <filename>
```
where `<filename>` is the name of the file to be translated.

# Functional Documentation

This script is designed to generate a technical and functional markdown documentation of a Python script using OpenAI. 

The script reads a Python file, tokenizes it and sends the tokens to the OpenAI API for translation. The translated text is then written into a markdown file.

The script requires a configuration file (config.json) with details of the OpenAI API key, endpoint, model ID, API version and the maximum number of tokens to be generated by the model.

The script can be run from the command line with the filename as an argument. The output is a markdown file with the same name as the input file, containing the translated text.
